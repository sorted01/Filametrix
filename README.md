This is a mod of the Voron Stealthburner which adds a filament cutting possibility!

#### Update for Revo Micro
- SB_RevoMicro_back
- SB_RevoMicro_front

by Leif Lang - NOTE: Remixed from the Official Stealthburner and the remixed version for the Revo Voron by Russel Gower

## Motivation
I was looking at the ERCF MMU for several month now. What always kept me from starting the project were the discussions about issues and problems with  filament tip forming. Suddenly a new company showed us how they do it quite reliable. They just cut the filament. Further motivated and inspired by the design of @pure100kim who has built the [ERCF_Filament_Cutting_MOD](https://github.com/pure100kim/ERCF_Filament_Cutting_MOD) I started to build my own version of it.

## See how it works

## Good to know
Please be aware:
- We will need to use one of the ADXL mounting threads
- Depending on the setup and position of the cutting point we will most probably not lose any build volume
- For the main body i remixed the ECAS version from [Alexanderor](https://www.printables.com/de/model/433797-clockwork-2-ecas-fitting-for-ercf)

## Extruder and Printhead options
### Extruder
#### Clockwork2 Extruder
Due to recent changes in the Clockwork2 design (July 2023) two motor plates exist, please check carefully which version you are using and print the corresponding main body.

M6 bowden mount
- SB_CW2_new_motor_plate_Main_Body_Cutting_with_M6

A more compact version using a M6 bowden fitting instead of the ECAS is also available for some main bodys. 
Additonally, a more rigid [latch](STL/[a]_latch_M6.stl) is available for the M6 version. (ECAS version of the latch is compatible with all M6 main bodys.)

## Assembly
### Cutting arm
#### Cut skalpel to length l=26mm
![image](https://github.com/sorted01/Filametrix/assets/83211473/c17c3605-2184-4c45-986b-4da3b65add38)
##### Result
![image](https://github.com/sorted01/Filametrix/assets/83211473/62f5fb5d-31df-4c98-a9ee-5afadb0f73e9)
#### Insert skalpel into knife holder
Insert the skalpel (which is cut to 26mm) into the knife holder until you see it in the little hole. Use pliers to push it into the knife holder. Some force should be needed as the skalpel should stay in place due to the "pressfit". If that's not the case add some glue.(Depelding on skalpel tolerances)
![image](https://github.com/sorted01/Filametrix/assets/83211473/b46f8143-e8a0-459e-af59-e8ae7ef47191)
#### Put knife holder into cutting arm
The M2.5x15 screw is directly screwed into the plastic of the knife holder. The tip of the screw should be flush with the cutting arm or no more than 0.1-0.3mm above it.
Check the orientation of the hole for the M2.5 screw in the knife holder. It needs to be on the bottom side.

**!! The knife holder must move up and down without friction in the cutting arm but shoult not have a lot play. Maybe some grinding is needed. !!**

### Add heat inserts

Tip here for the heat set that goes above the cutter I would suggest drilling the threads out with a ~2.5mm drill bit. On the hotend holder side below the cutter make sure you flare out the PTFE tube to help guide the filament.
#### Main body

#### SB cutting Printhead back
![image](https://github.com/sorted01/Filametrix/assets/83211473/e7a5901d-e755-4ad7-a55a-b15f54218cdb)
#### Depressor - one on either end, end with ribs should be flush with surface below ribs with no plastic sticking up past surface
![image](https://github.com/juliusjj25/Filametrix/assets/118471600/652e0256-451f-44c3-a2ec-b7ecb967395c)

#### Finished cutting point assembly should look like this
Note: for titanium backers, the backer should be centered between belt clamps and the end of the depressor mount should be flush with the end of the backer. This will work for all backers with 10/20/40mm spacing with the furthest back hole 5-15mm from the end. Height of depressor should be adjusted to press in the depression on the cutting arm and the BHCS can be adjusted in and out for the right positioning and locked in place with the M3 nut.

I need some time to finalize assembly instructions. If you have questions you'll find me in discord "sorted#8941"

## Code

**The code only works with https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare** If you haven't updated yet you really should.

Latest version provided by [thisiscam](https://github.com/thisiscam)

I added the option to push the filament tip back into the hotend

Copy additional.cfg to your printer config directory and include it in your printer.cfg below all of the mmu includes via [include additional.cfg]



### In mmu_parameters.cfg:
set form_tip_macro: _MMU_CUT_TIP

set toolhead_extruder_to_nozzle and toolhead_sensor_to_nozzle to corresponding measured values of your toolhead.

set force_form_tip_standalone: 1

### In additonal.cfg
You will need to adjust the parameters in addtional as well, like setting up your cutter location, speeds, etc. More information in the cfg file itself.
set variable_output_park_pos: ... to the distance from the nozzle tip to the blade

#### Servo
If you are using a gantry servo, remove the hashtags related to "gantry_servo"s in this file.

#### Optional Next location
The _MMU_CUT_TIP now has an option to move to a "next location" immediately after making the cut. For instance,  set it to the purge tower's location from the slicer. The _SET_LOC_AFTER_TOOLCHANGE sets this location, and the _MMU_CUT_TIP macro will be responsible for traveling immediately after the cut but prior to the unload. See the orcaslicer's toolchange gcode two messages down as an example. If you don't plan to use it, it's safe to ignore this point.
